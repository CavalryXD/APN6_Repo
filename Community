https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/netdev-FAQ.html#q-what-is-netdev

all network-related Linux development (i.e. RFC, review, comments, etc.) takes place on netdev.

There are always two trees (git repositories) in play. Both are driven by David Miller, the main network maintainer.

the net tree is for fixes to existing code already in the mainline tree from Linus, and net-next is where the new code goes for the future release.

At the beginning of the 2-week merge window, the net-next tree will be closed - no new changes/features. The accumulated new content of the past ~10 weeks will be passed onto mainline/Linus via a pull request for vX.Y – at the same time, the net tree will start accumulating fixes for this pulled content relating to vX.Y

Shortly after the two weeks have passed (and vX.Y-rc1 is released), the tree for net-next reopens to collect content for the next (vX.Y+1) release.

Q: I sent a patch and I’m wondering what happened to it?
Q: How can I tell whether it got merged? A: Start by looking at the main patchworks queue for netdev:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/
The “State” field will tell you exactly where things are at with your patch.




Q: How can I tell what patches are queued up for backporting to the various stable releases?
A: Normally Greg Kroah-Hartman collects stable commits himself, but for networking, Dave collects up patches he deems critical for the networking subsystem, and then hands them off to Greg.


Q: What level of testing is expected before I submit my change?
A: If your changes are against net-next, the expectation is that you have tested by layering your changes on top of net-next. Ideally you will have done run-time testing specific to your change, but at a minimum, your changes should survive an allyesconfig and an allmodconfig build without new warnings or failures.
